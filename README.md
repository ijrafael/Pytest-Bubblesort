# Pytest-Bubblesort

Make sure to install Pytest in a virtual environment and have at least Python 3.10 installed.

The python file bubble_sort.py contains code for a basic bubblesort algorithm. The file test_bubble_sort.py contains code to test that file using Pytest. This was created in my CPSC463 - Software Testing class.
